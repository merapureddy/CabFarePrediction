After fixing the model we want to deploy that model into production  .That can be done in two ways:
Either offline method or online method.If data that we used to build the model is confidential then we won't choose online method as data will be stored in cloud.
In offline method, we can assign schedulers and store the code in predefined location .That scheduler would invoke r and r wil start running.
In online method , we can use tools like ML azure or revo deployr .These tools would provide a framework or UI through which we can deploy a model.

In our case ,we can simply use Rshiny library in r to develop a basic level of user interface and we can share that link of webframe work with IP
 to client .So,client can use it as for new test cases.
